I started coding when I was 12 years old and have never stopped. I got my first professional job when I was 15, while I was in high school. I tried different universities, but I ended up dropping off all of them. 

I think not the best, but the only way to learn to code is by doing that as much as you can. I have more than 20 years of experience and am still spending at least 10 hours a day coding and a little more during the weekends. I am learning new things every day, and I absolutely love that.

I don't understand when people get burned out by coding for long hours. For me is the opposite. I feel very down when I am not coding :D

I created the *Pairing With Me* website to share some interesting stuff I am learning with myself. I think journaling is the best way to go back to what you have done and apply that again to another project (I don't mean copy and paste here). It would be fantastic if my notes were also valuable for other people. That would make me super happy.

If you like the content, please feel free to say hi on Twitter [@PairingWithMe](https://twitter.com/PairingWithMe)! That would mean the world to me!
