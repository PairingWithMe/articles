We are going to mock the API response with the data structure. 

We are going to mock the API response with the data structure.
The data structure is an array of genres; the `name`, `count`, and `color` represent each genre. 
It's essential to have the color. Otherwise, the whole chart will use the same color.

e.g.:

```json
{
  "name": "Comedy",
  "count": 29,
  "color": "red"
}
```
