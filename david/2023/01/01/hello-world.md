# Hello World

Hello, welcome to Pairing with Me.

I've noticed most technical articles detail all the related technologies and usually exceed the main topic with unnecessary information. Nowadays, people have no time to consume content. That's why shorts are trending, such as short posts, videos, etc.

Here, we will post short content about some specific topic with just enough information to answer one question or problem. The main idea is journalling about solving a common problem, which might help others in the same or similar scenario.

The solutions presented here are the best way we found to solve that problem at that time. There are other ways to solve the same problem, we might revisit some articles in the future, and we can write another article refactoring the solution we presented before.

The main goal is to share information and try to help ourselves, and hopefully others as well. We hope you enjoy it and find it helpful.
